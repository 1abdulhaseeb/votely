# Database Setup - Missing Tables Issue Resolution

## Problem Summary
You were missing several essential database components for your Votely application:

### What Was Missing:
1. **Entity Definitions** - Only had `User` and `Role` entities
2. **Database Service** - Controllers referenced a non-existent `DatabaseService`
3. **Database Module** - Referenced but didn't exist
4. **Proper Entity Relationships** - Missing foreign keys and relationships
5. **Missing Module Imports** - Not all modules were properly imported

### What I Added:

## 1. New Entity Files Created:

### `/src/polls/poll.entity.ts`
- Main polls table with status, type, multiple votes support
- Relationships to User (creator), PollOptions, and Votes

### `/src/polls/poll-option.entity.ts`
- Poll options with support for both generic and candidate-based polls
- Links to polls and candidates

### `/src/polls/vote.entity.ts`
- Stores individual votes
- Links users to specific poll options

### `/src/database/database.service.ts`
- Comprehensive service with all methods your controllers need:
  - User management (find, create, update roles)
  - Poll management (create, update, get results)
  - Voting functionality
  - Candidate statistics

### `/src/database/database.module.ts`
- Exports DatabaseService for use in other modules
- Imports all necessary entities for TypeORM

## 2. Updated Existing Files:

### `/src/users/user.entity.ts`
- Added `role` field with enum values
- Added `first_name` and `last_name` columns for database compatibility

### `/src/app.module.ts`
- Added all new entities to TypeORM configuration
- Imported PollsModule, CandidatesModule, and SimpleAuthModule

## 3. Database Structure Now Includes:

### Tables:
- `users` - User accounts with roles (voter, candidate, admin)
- `roles` - Role definitions (existing)
- `polls` - Poll definitions with status and settings
- `poll_options` - Individual options for each poll
- `votes` - Individual vote records

### Relationships:
- User → Polls (creator relationship)
- Poll → PollOptions (one-to-many)
- Poll → Votes (one-to-many)
- PollOption → Votes (one-to-many)
- User → Votes (voter relationship)
- User → PollOptions (candidate relationship for candidate-based polls)

## 4. Seed File Created:
`/src/database/seed.ts` - Sample data creation including:
- Admin user (admin@votely.com / admin123)
- Sample candidates and voters
- Example polls (generic and candidate-based)

## How to Use:

### 1. Run Database Migration:
```bash
cd backend
npm run start:dev
```
This will automatically create all tables due to `synchronize: true` in your TypeORM config.

### 2. Seed Sample Data (Optional):
You can run the seed function to populate sample data.

### 3. Test APIs:
All your existing API endpoints should now work properly:
- User registration/login
- Poll creation and management
- Voting functionality
- Candidate management

## Environment Variables Needed:
Make sure you have these in your `.env` file:
```
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=your_db_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DATABASE_NAME=votely
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=3600s
```

## Next Steps:
1. Set up your PostgreSQL database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run the application with `npm run start:dev`
4. Test the APIs to ensure everything works
5. Consider running the seed function to populate sample data

Your application should now have all the necessary database tables and relationships to support the complete voting system functionality!
